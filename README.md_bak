# x_make_pip_updates_x — Dependency Refinery

This refinery keeps the lab’s Python stack current without gambling on unverified wheels. Every upgrade is planned, executed, hashed, and logged before it enters production.

## Mission Log
- Inspect installed versus requested versions, flag drift, and plan remediation batches.
- Force reinstall packages with hash verification and JSON ledgers so auditors know exactly what changed.
- Integrate optional `pip-audit`, `pip-tools`, and graph analysis when the release warrants deeper scrutiny.
- Feed the orchestrator’s propagation stage with deterministic evidence of each upgrade wave.
- Continuously validate archived JSON ledgers so historical evidence keeps passing schema audits.

## Instrumentation
- Python 3.11 or newer.
- Ruff, Black, MyPy, Pyright, pytest for quality sweeps.
- Optional: `pip-audit`, `pip-tools`, visualization aides when advanced checks are enabled.

## Operating Procedure
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python x_cls_make_pip_updates_x.py --help`

Select the desired run mode—dry-run, force reinstall, audit—and capture the emitted JSON ledger alongside the orchestrator summary.

## Evidence Checks
| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting sweep | `python -m black .` |
| Lint interrogation | `python -m ruff check .` |
| Type audit | `python -m mypy .` |
| Static contract scan | `python -m pyright` |
| Functional verification | `pytest` |

## Reconstitution Drill
During the monthly rebuild I execute a forced reinstall sweep on a fresh lab machine, log hashes, runtime, pip version, and ensure the orchestrator records the propagation evidence. Any anomaly leads straight to a Change Control entry and corrective patch.

## Conduct Code
Every dependency shift must include before/after versions, hashes, and remediation notes in Change Control. If verification fails, halt the run—uncertainty is more toxic than delay.

## Sole Architect's Note
I built this refinery alone: upgrade planners, hash verifiers, JSON ledgers, orchestrator integration. My track record in high-stakes release pipelines is why you can rely on this automation.

## Legacy Staffing Estimate
- Without modern assistance you’d need: 1 senior packaging engineer, 1 DevOps release manager, 1 security analyst, and 1 technical writer.
- Delivery horizon: 12–14 engineer-weeks for parity.
- Budget: USD 100k–130k plus ongoing vulnerability monitoring.

## Technical Footprint
- Language & Framework: Python 3.11+, subprocess orchestration, JSON reporting, PowerShell templates for Windows parity.
- Tooling: pip force-reinstall, optional `pip-audit`, `pip-tools`, custom hash verifiers, shared logging via `x_make_common_x`.
- Quality Gate: Ruff, Black, MyPy, Pyright, pytest, Change Control hooks for evidence.
- Integration: Orchestrator propagation stage, environment vault coordination, publish handshake with `x_make_pypi_x`.
