# x_make_pip_updates_x — Production Ledger

I record every significant change to this dependency refinery here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so upgrade evidence maps cleanly to release history.

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Sanitised the 2025-10-26 upgrade ledger so the archived `result` payload matches the published schema and keeps historical evidence valid during regression sweeps.

## [0.20.4] - 2025-10-15
### Changed
- Documented the Kanban propagation column hookup: upgrade ledgers now register with the orchestrator summary and surface in the Road to 0.20.4 evidence trail.
- README refreshed to steer operators toward the new 0.20.4 board cadence and propagation audit expectations.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- README and ops guide rewritten to connect upgrade batches to the Road to 0.20.3 JSON audit feed.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Realigned documentation with the Road to 0.20.2 upgrade doctrine, clarifying dependency audit expectations for this release.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Extracted the shared `update_flow` delegate so the orchestrator now pulls one lever for pip governance.
- Rewired the README and release log to point straight at the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger—everyone cooks from the same playbook.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Authored control-room styled README and changelog aligning package governance with the Road to 0.20.0 initiative.
- Linked dependency automation to the Change Control hub and publishing pipeline channels.

### Changed
- Reinforced the rule: every upgrade gets a documented hash, a compatibility check, and a logged remediation path before release.
